# SFDC trigger framework

I know, I know. There are tons. But this one is mine.

## Overview

Triggers should (IMO) be logicless. Putting logic into your triggers creates un-testable, difficult-to-maintain code. It's widely accepted that a best-practice is to move trigger logic into a handler class.

This trigger framework bundles a single **TriggerHandler** base class that you can inherit from in all of your trigger handlers. The base class includes context-specific methods that are automatically called when a trigger is executed.

## Usage

To create a trigger handler, you simply need to create a class that inherits from **TriggerHandler.cls**. Here is an example for creating an Opportunity trigger handler.

```java
public class OpportunityTriggerHandler extends TriggerHandler {
```

In your trigger handler, to add logic to any of the trigger contexts, you only need to override them in your trigger handler. Here is how we would add logic to a `beforeUpdate` trigger.

```java
public class OpportunityTriggerHandler extends TriggerHandler {
  
  public override void beforeUpdate() {
    for(Opportunity o : (List<Opportunity>) Trigger.new) {
      // do something
    }
  }

  // add overrides for other contexts

}
```

**Note:** When referencing the Trigger statics within a class, SObjects are returned versus SObject subclasses like Opportunity, Account, etc. This means that you must cast when you reference them in your trigger handler. You could do this in your constructor if you wanted. Just remember to call super() at the end to run the parent's constructor. Right now, there is no logic in the parent's constructor but there could be one day.

```java
public class OpportunityTriggerHandler extends TriggerHandler {

  private Map<Id, Opportunity> newOppMap;

  public OpportunityTriggerHandler() {
    this.newOppMap = (Map<Id, Opportunity>) Trigger.newMap;
    super();
  }
  
  public override void afterUpdate() {
    //
  }

}
```

To use the trigger handler, you only need to construct an instance of your trigger handler within the trigger handler itself and call the `run()` method. Here is an example of the Opportunity trigger.

```java
trigger OpportunityTrigger on Opportunity (before insert, before update) {
  new OpportunityTriggerHandler().run();
}
```

Here are all of the methods that you can override. All of the context possibilities are supported.

* `beforeInsert()`
* `beforeUpdate()`
* `beforeDelete()`
* `afterInsert()`
* `afterUpdate()`
* `afterDelete()`
* `afterUndelete()`
